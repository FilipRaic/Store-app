# Store-app
This is an ongoing Java project. The goal is to create an application that allows us to simulate a store managing and purchase system.

The idea is to achieve an application with GUI and functionality to simulate a webshop with the abbility to list through items, put them in a cart and buy.

This release uses a GUI and text files to draw data, instead of relying on the users input. All GUI elements were created using JavaFX.
This version also uses Logback to keep track of all the important events, such as application starting and file reading and any errors that could occur due to those actions.
