# Store-app
This is an ongoing Java project. The goal is to create an application that allows us to simulate a store managing and purchase system.

The idea is to achieve an application with GUI and functionality to simulate a webshop with the abbility to list through items, put them in a cart and buy.

This release uses the terminal to enter data into the application.
